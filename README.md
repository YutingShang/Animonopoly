# Animonopoly

The classic *Monopoly* game with a twist - each postion you land on is a type of animal, which you can choose to purchase. 

The command line interface guides you through the game, with an `ASCII` art game board

This was a group project, the original repository is at https://github.com/samreed18/animonopoly  
The original repository project structure was a bit broken, so I fixed it in this repository.

Run the `MainProgram` to start playing!

Player 1 will roll first

The dice will be rolled and displayed. You will move on the board as your chosen character.  
If you roll a double, a `chance card` will be randomly chosen. This will either take money or give you money.

When someone goes bankrupt, this will be displayed and the player will automatically go out.
